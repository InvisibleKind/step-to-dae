.step-to-.dae
=============

Little program to convert 3D models in .step format to .dae format using FreeCAD and Meshlab

Introduction
------------

I wrote this program because I wanted to use .step 3D models in Google Sketchup with Open Source Software. The way I found was to convert to binary stl format using FreeCAD and then to Collada (DAE) with Meshlab. This program is just a Python script that makes this process automatic.
